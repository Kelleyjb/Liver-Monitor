# Liver Monitor
 Performs K-Cluster Analysis With Limited User Interface
 The code for this program will be broken into three sections: UI for import/selection, interl k-cluster creation/analysis, and a final UI to examine results.
 
 ## Initial UI
  The initial user interface (UI) will allow for the user to select their csv file, filter any unwanted columns from consideration, and select desired settings for the K-Cluster.
  It will be broken into two Stages "Import" and "Settings".
  The settings will include toggles for: 
  - Graph 
  - Table (Outliers) 
  - Table (Full)
  
 ## K - Cluster
  K clusters will be made from designated file and fields according to selected settings.
 
 ## Final UI
  This interface will be responsible for displaying K-cluster results as well as holding options for reloading/manipulation of data.
